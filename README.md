# Rick_roll_trolling_code
this is a code that will rick roll your troll target, oh and Rush E the target too. THIS MAY RUIN THE TARGET'S COMPUTER IF HES USING POTATO COMPUTER, DO NOT USE THIS TROLL CODE TOO OVER(tho the code without improvement is kinda too over already lol). MAKE SURE YOU GOT ENOUGH STUFF TO RECOVER THE TARGET'S COMPUTER CUZ IT MIGHT BE RUINED BY OVER-LAGGING FROM TENTHS TO THOUSANDS OF EARRAPING VIDEO TABS
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
To run this code, pynput and appJar is needed to be installed by pip. If you are not sure if you got a pip or not, open your cmd and type pip --version . If the cmd returns "no such command pip" or sth like that(I forgot lol), please install one.
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
To make the detection-trigger of the code works, permission to monitor the input of the computer is needed, if not, tabs can only be generated manually.
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
For the code which triggers the tab generation program by keyboard inputs, please go to the "code" branch. For the code which triggers it by mouse inputs, please go to "code(mouse_edition)" branch.
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
The 2 editions of the program is nearly the same, the only difference is which pynput program (or lets say which trigger mode) its using. Use them on your flavor.
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
I repeat here again, this code may ruin someone's potato computer by generating huge amount of media tabs, please don't use this troll code for any purpose which leads to losts of datas, computers, etc. Thank you.
